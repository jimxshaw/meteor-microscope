<!--
It isn't efficient to define one route per post as there could be 
hundreds of posts or more. Thus, a single dynamic route must 
be created to display any post we want. This template serves
as a dynamic route from router.js .

<template name="postPage">
  <div class="post-page page">
    {{> postItem}}
  </div>
